Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the maximum difference between any two numbers in the array where the larger element appears after the smaller element.
  
let arr = [];
let size=5
for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    arr[i] = Number(prompt("Enter any number: "));
}
let max = 0
let k = 0;
console.log("maximum difference :", difference(arr))

function difference(arr){
for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < size; j++) {
        let diff = arr[i] - arr[j];
        if (max<diff) {
            max = diff
        }
    }
}
return max
}
